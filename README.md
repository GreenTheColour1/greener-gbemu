# Greener-gbemu

This is an emulator for A GameBoy (and maybe a GameBoy Colour?)

This is a project that aims to achive the following goals

1. Learn how to program in Go
2. Learn how computers operate at a low level
3. (More to be added as I run into challenges)

This project is very outside my comfort zone as far as my existing programming knowledge is concerned so I am likely to make quite a bit of mistakes, but what is learning without a few mistakes along the way

No AI is being to write any code in this project

Special thanks to:

- [System of Levers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy2yY5a1Z-0) for this inspiration to start this project
- [gbdev.io](https://gbdev.io/) for the amazing collection of resources on how a GameBoy works
